# Underwater-waste-detection-yolov8
Underwater waste sorting and classification system using yolov8 and django for real time detection.
# Underwater Waste Detection using YOLOv8 and Django

# Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying underwater waste using a deep learning-based object detection model. The system helps identify different types of waste materials found underwater to support marine cleanliness and environmental protection.

##  Objectives
- Detect underwater waste in real-time
- Classify waste into different categories
- Improve awareness of underwater pollution using AI
- Support future integration with cleaning or monitoring systems

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Object Detection)
- Django (Web Framework)
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## System Description
The YOLOv8 model is trained on underwater waste images to detect objects with high accuracy. The Django framework is used to provide a simple interface for running detection and managing results. The system can process images or video feeds and display detected waste with bounding boxes and class labels.
